# SenedaCV
A simple computervision library in c++

To Do:
- Write unit tests for modules
  - Get some simple images and check that the convolutions work
- Do a full implementation of canny edge detection

Goals:
- ~~Loading in simple image files~~
- Displaying images.
- Applying Convolution filters to images.
- Write a script which will read in a file containing instructions:
 - specify and image, specify a set of kernels, specify an output file name
 - load the image and convolve with the filters and save the output.
- Generate key filter kernels at given sizes.
- ??
- Blurring and downscaling images
- Interpolating and upscaling images
- ??
- Edge detection
- ??
- Feature detection (Something like SIFT)
- ??
